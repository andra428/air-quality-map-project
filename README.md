# Maps & Statistics Devices Project

A web application for monitoring air quality data through user-added devices.  
The app allows authenticated users to place devices on a map and view statistics such as **AQI, temperature, COâ‚‚, and PM2.5** based on location.  
It uses **React (with Vite)**, **Redux** for state management, **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore** for storing device data, **Leaflet** for interactive maps, and **Jest** for testing. Styling is done with **CSS Modules**.

## General Description

The goal of the application is to display air quality information from different devices on a map. Authenticated users can add devices that act as sensors and visualize environmental data for specific areas.
